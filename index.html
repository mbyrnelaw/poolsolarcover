This simulation models heat transfer from the sun to a pool with and without a solid cover, accounting for evaporative losses, convection, radiation, and solar gain. Conditions are based on summer in central Florida (average air temp 24-32°C, humidity 80%, wind 3 m/s, solar insolation peaking at ~627 W/m²). Pool size: 50 m² surface, 75 m³ volume. Click the button to run the 24-hour simulation.
